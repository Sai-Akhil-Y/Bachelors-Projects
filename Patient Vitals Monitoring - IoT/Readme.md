### The Problem and Solution

The problem the Life Alarm aims to solve is the constant attention required for bedridden patients and the high cost of complex monitoring systems. This leads to decreased caretaker productivity and financial strain on families.

The proposed solution is a system that uses vital sensors and radio communication to alert a caretaker when a patient needs help. The process is simple:

1. A patient presses a button or their vital signs spike.
2. A receiver alerts the caretaker with a sound.
3. The caretaker then checks on the patient.
